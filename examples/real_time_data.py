PyXLL Examples: Real time data

As well as returning static values from functions, PyXLL functions
can return Real Time Data (RTD) that updates the value in Excel.

Python RTD functions can be written as Python generators, async generators,
or using the PyXLL RTD class.

RTD functions can be used for any real time data feed, such as live
prices or the status of a service.
